# [Day-3] Schedule an End-to-End Data Pipeline

In this section, we are going to implement scheduling for our ETL pipeline that we have learned.

How to decompose dag based on its best practice: https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/dag-best-practices

## Understand how to integrate a data pipeline into airflow

Setup a DAG script
- Prepare the dataset (some CSV files or URL)
- Create code to ingest the dataset to our datawarehouse with python
    1. define when the DAG will be run, start_date
    2. define the interval of the DAG
- Setup Postgresql DB Connection
- Define tasks in a DAG : 
    1. task-1: define empty operator
    2. task-2: create connection and table in postgresql with PostgresOperator
    3. task-3: ingest data from file with PythonOperator
    4. task-4: command to move data from Postgresql to Citus with Airbyte
    5. task-5: dbt command to transform data with DbtOperator, BashOperator or SSHOperator
- Create dependencies between tasks
- Test the workflows
